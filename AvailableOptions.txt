-- Available options

==== not really ====

o Switch Case (probably not)

o State Machine (not sure right now)

o Utility AI (presumably too much for this project)

==== more likely ====

o Decision Tree

o Behaviour Tree (maybe this)
    x Blackboard
    x BaseNode
        + States: Success, Failure, Running
        + Evaluate()
    x Sequence : BaseNode
    x Selector : BaseNode
    x Action   : BaseNode
    x Decorators???


Behaviour Tree: 
More reasonable and flexible options instead of decision Tree (Selector and Sequence).
Utility AI too sophisticated for this project, too many options for just a few actions.
